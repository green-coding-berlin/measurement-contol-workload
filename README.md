# Introduction

This repository is used for cluster machines in the [Green Metrics Tool](https://github.com/green-coding-berlin/green-metrics-tool) to evaluate their measurement behaviour.

It should be run at defined intervals to check if the machines has a stable accuracy and bias in it's measurement.

Check out our timeline projects to see an overview: https://metrics.green-coding.berlin/energy-timeline.html
